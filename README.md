# Vehicle-detection-and-Tracking
## The   goals   /   steps   of   this   project   are   the   following:
1. Perform  feature  extraction  on  a  labeled  training  set  of  images,  this includes   HOG   (Histogram   of   Oriented   Gradients)   feature   and   color   feature
2. Train  SVM  classifier
3. Implement  a  sliding  window  technique  and  use  the  trained  classifier  to
search   for   vehicles   in   images
4. Run  the  tracking  pipeline  on  a  video  stream.  Create  a  heat  map  of
recurring   detections   frame   by   frame   to   reject   outliers   and   follow   detected
vehicles
5. Estimate  a  bounding  box  for  vehicles  detected.
